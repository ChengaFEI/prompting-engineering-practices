# Thoughts after watching GPT-4 Developer Livestream

## Topic 1:

A chatgpt-based programming language that only uses natural languages

The structure of this new language is alike a traditional programming language but each component/element will be written in natural language.

1. source code files

It could be replaced by the technical document with detailed description of functionalities of a method/class/framework/webpage/application.

It can be shared in a markdown document repository that is similar to GitHub and Docker Hub.

When developers need to use any pre-written application, they can prompt ChatGPT to download the document and include them in the current file.

Maybe the syntax could be

```bash
learn <technical-document-name>.md from "/link/to/file/source"
```

which is similar to the following code in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

This new natural programming language will complete a whole web application with the same amount of Javascript codes that could only define a component/webpage.

2. source file management

Similar to Maven/Gradle, there might need to some natural-language based packages/frameworks that streamline the storage, transmission, compilation, management of the dependencies and integrate dependency management in the prompting process.

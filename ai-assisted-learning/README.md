# ai-assisted-learning

This module contains prompting practices that employs AIGC tools to teach a complete beginner theories/skills from scratch, and build a complex application with natural languages only (without manually writing any code).

## Rules

1. Know nothing about basic concepts in the field.
2. Only use selected AIGC platform/tool as learning resources.

## Assumptions

1. Concepts are key things to learn because they are the most accurate and the most succinct language to communicate people's requirements/desires/imaginations with AIGC tools.
2. Proficiency in writing programming languages / using knowledge is not important as long as people master all the concepts and express their ideas with concepts clearly. It is because AIGC can take care of all the repetitive technical jobs and complete them faster than human beings.
3. Creativity > Proficiency

## Goals

1. Enable any complete beginner to learn knowledge from concepts and practices/examples
2. Enable any complete beginner to realize complex functionalities by communicating ideas with AIGC tools using natural languages.

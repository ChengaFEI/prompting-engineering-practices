# ai-assisted-learning

This module contains prompting practices that employs AIGC tools to teach a complete beginner theories/skills from scratch, and build a complex application with natural languages only (without manually writing any code).

## Rules

1. Know nothing about basic concepts in the field.
2. Only use selected AIGC platform/tool as learning resources.
3. Only use selected AIGC platform/tool to build the capstone project.
4. Only use natural languages and never write any code.

## Assumptions

1. Concepts are key things to learn because they are the most accurate and the most succinct language to communicate people's requirements/desires/imaginations with AIGC tools.
2. Proficiency in writing programming languages / using knowledge is not important as long as people master all the concepts and express their ideas using concepts clearly. It is because AIGC tools can take care of all the repetitive technical jobs and complete them faster than human beings.
3. Creativity > Proficiency

## Goals

1. Enable any complete beginner to learn concepts from practices/examples.
2. Enable any complete beginner to build complex applications by communicating their ideas with AIGC tools using natural languages.

## Tips for Learners

1. Build connections between concepts and code snippets.
2. Build connections between code snippets and application functionalities.
